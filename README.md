MagicShow
=========

An Interactive Scene 

Three distinct pages with an overriding theme
Magic week was my chosen theme 
Shown by the "magic show" feel

Only a few classes have actual code. The other classes are empty 
so I can call the art they reference to the screen
The classes with relevant code are:
credits.as

game.as

howTo.as

lose.as

main.as

screenControl.as

The postMortum.odt contains my post mortum about the game
It is a text file

Made in Flash. October 3rd, 2012.
